# Risk stratification of patients suffering Brugada Syndrome by ECG-derived biomarkers and supervised classification models
### Final Degree Project | Bachelor's Degree in Bioinformatics | ESCI-UPF
## Project Description
Brugada syndrome is an inherited cardiac disorder primarily affecting the heartâ€™s electrical conduction system. This condition is distinguished by characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns and is predominantly associated with mutations in twelve gene pairs, with the most significant alterations occurring in the SCN5A gene. Although individuals with Brugada syndrome are often asymptomatic, they are at risk of experiencing syncope, dizziness, seizures, and sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias. Consequently, the identification of high-risk patients who require prophylactic interventions, such as the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), is crucial. However, the absence of reliable predictors for the initial onset of fatal symptoms complicates risk stratification. This research seeks to rigorously evaluate and determine the most effective supervised learning model for differentiating between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using biomarkers derived from ECG and clinical data.
